# Network types
## Peer-based:
Peer-based, or Peer-to-peer (P2P) is when multiple devices share resources without the use of an external server. 

relate each type to aspects like purpose,
benefits, 
resource implications, 
communications, 
working practice, 
commercial opportunity, 
information sharing, 
collaboration


## client-server:
This is the use of a central server that communicates, and shares data with multiple computers on the network.

relate each type to aspects like purpose,
benefits, 
resource implications, 
communications, 
working practice, 
commercial opportunity, 
information sharing, 
collaboration


## cloud:
Cloud servers are remote servers that are totally virtual. These virtual servers can be purchased for alot cheaper than physical servers.

## cluster:
A cluster is when multiple nodes (computers, devices connected to the network) are linked together to perform one task. 

relate each type to aspects like purpose,

information sharing, 
collaboration


## centralised
With this network there is a central server that all users will connect to. This server will store the information that you provide to them, aswell as any communication you've had.

benefits, 
resource implications, 
communications, 
working practice, 
commercial opportunity, 
information sharing, 
collaboration


## virtualised 
- External virtulisation is the when multiple networks are connected together to form a virtual unit. 
- Internal virtulisation is when a simulated network is given to a container on a network.
