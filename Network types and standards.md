# Network Types, and Standards.

## Terms Relating to Networking

### Services and Network Applications
**FTP**


File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an internet protocol that is used to transfer files. The files are transmitted via TCP/IP between computers on the internet.

**HTTP**


Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is what is sent to a server when you type in an HTTP address. If the link is functional then a copy of the website and any associated files will be sent to your computers webpage.  

**SMTP**


Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used when sending and recieving an email. It is typically used with POP3 or IMAP that save messages to a server mailbox. This protocol is an internet standard for electronic mail. 

**POP3**


Post Office Protocol (POP) is an internet standard protocol. Mail servers use POP to recieve emails from an IP, and filter and catorgorise the mail recieved.+

**SSL**


Secure Socket Layers are used to establish an encrypted link between the web server and the browser. Encrypting the data prevents your privacy from being vulnerable.

## Networking devices
**Hubs**
A hub, also called a network hub, is a common connection point for devices in a network.


**Routers**
A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.


**Switches**
A switch, in the context of networking is a high-speed device that receives incoming data packets and redirects them to their destination on a local area network (LAN).


**Multiplayer switch**
A multilayer switch is a network device that has the ability to operate at higher layers of the OSI reference model, unlike the Data Link Layer (DLL) traditionally used by switches.


**Firewall**
In computing, a firewall is software or firmware that enforces a set of rules about what data packets will be allowed to enter or leave a network.


**HIDS**
A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an intrusion detection system that is capable of monitoring and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces, similar to the way a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) operates.


**Repeaters**
A network device used to regenerate or replicate a signal. 


**Bridges**
A bridge is a type of computer network device that provides interconnection with other bridge networks that use the same protocol.


**Wireless devices**
Devices with a wifi radio that you use to connect to a wireless access point, e.g. a computer, cell phone or tablet device.


**Access point (wireless/wired)**
An access point is a device, such as a wireless router, that allows wireless devices to connect to a network. Most access points have built-in routers, while others must be connected to a router in order to provide network access.


**Content filter**
Content filtering is used by corporations as part of Internet firewall computers and also by home computer owners, especially by parents to screen the content their children have access to from a computer.


**Load balancer**
Network load balancing (NLB) is the management of traffic across a network without the use of complex routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).


**Modem**
A modem is a device or program that enables a computer to transmit data over, for example, telephone or cable lines.


**Packet shaper**
The packet shaper is a device that sits in between the campus network and the outside network. All incoming and outgoing traffic passes through it. Its purpose is to classify the traffic passing through, and prioritize that traffic based on rules that we define.


**VPN concentrator**
A VPN concentrator is a type of networking device that provides secure creation of VPN connections and delivery of messages between VPN nodes. It is a type of router device, built specifically for creating and managing VPN communication infrastructures.


## Server types
**Web**
A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well.


**File**
File Server. As the name implies, a file server is a server that provides access to files. It acts as a central file storage location that can be accessed by multiple systems.


**Database**
A database server is a server which houses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the clientâ€“server model.


**Combination**
A hybrid hosting service or hybrid server is a type of Internet hosting which is a combination of a physically-hosted server with virtualization technology.


**Virtulisation**
A virtual server is a server that shares hardware and software resources with other operating systems (OS), versus dedicated servers. Because they are cost-effective and provide faster resource control, virtual servers are popular in Web hosting environments.


**Terminal services server**
Generally in information technology, a terminal server is a hardware device or server that provides terminals (PCs, printers, and other devices) with a common connection point to a local or wide area network. The terminals connect to the terminal server from their RS-232C or RS-423 serial port.


# Network types
### Peer-based:
Peer-based, or Peer-to-peer (P2P) is when multiple devices share resources without the use of an external server. P2P is most commonly associated with piracy, and its clear why. P2P networks are made up of many users (ideally) that, while on the server, act as file servers. The things you need to connect to a P2P server is an internet connection, and P2P software.   


**Benefits**
- A peer to peer network is easier to set up.
- All nodes act of a server.
- Cheap to maintain.


**Resource Implications**
You will need two, or more computers to create a P2P network.


**Communications**
Communications will be between the computers connected via P2P.


**Working Practice**
Miminal work involved in the maintenance due to it's simplicity.


**Commercial Opportunity**
Very useful within a business. As it allows you to share files and data between computers on the P2P network. 


**Information Sharing**
If the sending and recieving computer are on the same network, then information can be passed back and forth.


### client-server:
This is the use of a central server that communicates, and shares data with multiple computers on the 
network.


**Benefits**
- Data is shared giving user's the ability to access files and data on the server.  
- Network peripherals are controlled centrally.
- All files are stored in a central location.


**Resource Implications**
You would need a main client which would act as the server, and also other connected client PC's. Once connected, clients will be able to share their data with one another.


**Communications**
Clients communicate with eachother directly due to them being on a client server.


**Commercial Opportunity**
This is good for companies that share data, as it allows user's to easily share between eachother.


### cloud:
Cloud servers are remote servers that are totally virtual. These virtual servers can be purchased for alot cheaper than physical servers.


**Benefits**
- Reduced maintenance costs.
- As its not a phisical object you save on space.
- Can maintain a massive network.
- Can access data from most devices.


**Resource Implications**
To implement a cloud network you will need hardware enabling you to create a virtual network. You will also need a router that will connect to said virtual network.


**Communications**
Because it is wireless it allows users to seamlessly share with eachother other, aslong as they're connected to the same cloud.


**Working Practice**
While using a cloud network you can create firewall's for your virtual network making it more secure. This is very important for buisnesses due to sensitive information that may be shared.


**Commercial Opportunity**
Information stored on the cloud can be accesses from anywhere. This allows for companies, employees to easily collaborate with eachother.


### cluster:
A cluster is when multiple nodes (computers, devices connected to the network) are linked together to perform one task. 


**Benefits**
- If one server shutdowns another one is active to replace it.
- Can be used for smaller, or larger networks depending on the amount of devices connected.


**Resource Implications**
Clients access the networks one, or more, servers to direct traffic around the network.


**Communications**
Mssages can be sent between PC's via the network.


### centralised
With this network there is a central server that all users will connect to. This server will store the information that you provide to them, aswell as any communication you've had.


**Resource Implications**
The resources what will be needed for this network to be implemented would be the clients and the main server which holds all the information and communication.


**Communications**
The communications that are created on the network are stored on the main server which handles all the things about the network.


**Working practice**
The working practice for this network is that all the conversations and information is passed through the server which can them check for any unwanted or inappropriate content allowed on and out of the network.


**Information sharing**
information can be shared throughout the network but it must pass through and stored on the main server which can then be seen later for monetisation and review.


### virtualised 
- External virtulisation is the when multiple networks are connected together to form a virtual unit. 
- Internal virtulisation is when a simulated network is given to a container on a network. 


**Resource Implications**
the resources that are needed for create this network would be the physical components for the physical server which would be the clients, server and the router to connect to the cloud network.


**Communications**
Communications will be easy to do by being able to communicate with anyone connected to the network (cloud/physical). The speed may be quicker if the target client is on the same physical network as you rather than sending it over the cloud.


**Working Practice**
the working practise for this network maybe cause problems because the room for error is larger now that two different types of networks are connected. A problem may occur on the virtual network which might be not detected by the physical network which may take it a while to be detected and removed.


**Information Sharing**
information sharing
Information sharing will become easier on a network because it will allow people to communicate around the world by using the virtual network and they can also communicate around the local network without relying on the virtual network.
