### Services and network applications
**FTP**


File transfer protocol is an internet protocol that is used to transfer files. The files are transmitted via TCP/IP between computers on the internet.

**HTTP**


Hypertext Transfer Protocol is what is sent to a server when you type in an HTTP address. If the link is functional then a copy of the website and any associated files will be sent to your computers webpage.

# Network types
### Peer-based:
Peer-based, or Peer-to-peer (P2P) is when multiple devices share resources without the use of an external server. P2P is most commonly associated with piracy, and its clear why. P2P networks are made up of many users (ideally) that, while on the server, act as file servers. The things you need to connect to a P2P server is an internet connection, and P2P software.   


### client-server:
This is the use of a central server that communicates, and shares data with multiple computers on the network.

resource implications, 
communications, 
working practice, 
commercial opportunity, 
information sharing, 
collaboration


### cloud:
Cloud servers are remote servers that are totally virtual. These virtual servers can be purchased for alot cheaper than physical servers.

### cluster:
A cluster is when multiple nodes (computers, devices connected to the network) are linked together to perform one task.

### centralised
With this network there is a central server that all users will connect to. This server will store the information that you provide to them, aswell as any communication you've had.

### virtualised 
- External virtulisation is the when multiple networks are connected together to form a virtual unit. 
- Internal virtulisation is when a simulated network is given to a container on a network.
